<p>The DeVos Sport Business Management Program is a master’s degree program in sport business management that accepted its inaugural class in the fall of 2002. It is a landmark program, focusing on business skills necessary for graduates to conduct successful careers in the rapidly changing and dynamic sports industry while also emphasizing diversity, community service and sport and social issues.</p>

<p>The DeVos Program is an integrative “living classroom” with a rigorous and comprehensive academic curriculum that keeps teams of students together throughout their two years of coursework. The program is distinguished by its solid core of strategic and analytical business courses, combined with a unique offering of classes that emphasize the social impact of sport. Additionally, the program provides one of the few opportunities in the country to earn an MBA with a concentration in sport business. Students will learn about the role of sport in society, how the power of sport can help create a more inclusive society, and the responsibility of sport to use that power to make a difference in our world. Furthermore, each student will have an individual mentor – a professional with master’s degree credentials who is currently employed in sports.</p>

<h3>Curriculum</h3>	

<p>The curriculum incorporates UCF College of Business Administration core classes with specific sport business classes. By combining coursework with internships, interactive projects and programs that allow students to work along-side world-class sport business leaders, the program offers both a superior education and network of contacts to help create rewarding post- graduation opportunities.</p>
