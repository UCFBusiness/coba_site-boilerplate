		<h2>Internships</h2>
		<p>Department of Finance internships are available to juniors and seniors majoring in finance. To qualify for an internship, undergraduate students must have successfully completed FIN 3403 Business Finance and at least one other 3000 or 4000 level finance course, and must have a minimum overall GPA of 2.75 and a GPA of 3.0 in the major.</p>
		<p>All internships must be related to the field of finance. The objective of the program is to provide students with experience in finance that they would not otherwise have obtained. Therefore, students may not arrange internships with former or current employers. In rare cases, the internship coordinator may approve an internship with a student’s current employer if the job responsibilities assigned to the intern provide a different and appropriate experience in finance.</p>
		<p>The Finance Internship Coordinator is Dr. Richard Curcio. The Finance Internship Packet needs to be filled out and turned into the Finance Department in BA1, room 409 in person. Internship packets are due 10 days before the first day of class of each semester by 4:00pm. (See the UCF academic calendar for the dates). This will allow time for processing paperwork and registering. Late internship application packets will not be accepted after this date. Internship applicants must provide a picture identification (current driver’s license will suffice) and original signatures from the intern employer. If your internship is approved, the Department of Finance will email a permission number to you at your Knights email address allowing you to register for the internship course.</p>
		<p>For help finding an Internship, please go to the Business Satellite Office of Experiential Learning, located in BA1, room 130. The phone number is (407) 823-5581 and the website is www.explearning.ucf.edu.</p>
		<p>Internships are academic courses that allow students to apply classroom theory in a practical work setting and gain personal, academic and work competencies.</p>

		<h2>Careers</h2>
		<hgroup>
			<h3>What can I do with this major?</h3>
			<h4>General Information and Strategies</h4>
		</hgroup>
		<p>For anyone interested in entering the real estate world, a specialized degree in the field can provide a versatile path into the industry.  Although a college degree has not been traditionally required in the past, completing these studies can result in significantly more opportunities for success.  The degree can also act as a springboard to a variety of other career options.  A real estate graduate can apply his or her knowledge to numerous facets of the industry.  For new graduates with little to no experience in the field, a Realtor position is often recommended, as it can lay the groundwork for what they would like to accomplish in the future.</p>
		<h4>Real Estate Agent</h4>
		<p>The most common career choice for a real estate graduate is a real estate agent, or Realtor.  Real estate agents work with potential sellers by listing homes and with potential buyers by helping them narrow their interests, generate a list of home options that fit their preferences, and show them the homes.  When the buyer decides to make an offer, Realtors prepare the paperwork for the offer and begin working with the seller's agent to close the sale.  The standard commission for Realtors is around 5 percent of the accepted offer on the home.</p>
		<h4>Property Management</h4>
		<p>Property managers handle rental properties.  When a homeowner decides to rent out a property but does not want to manage the specifics of looking for renters and keeping up with property maintenance, the homeowner can use a property management agency.  In some cases, real estate offices will offer property management services on the side; in other cases the property management is the sole business.  Homeowners typically pay their property managers about 10 percent of the monthly rental price.  In areas with high rent and constant potential for renters -- often areas dominated by military bases -- working in property management can be very profitable.</p>
		<h4>Brokerage Work</h4>
		<p>A real estate broker position can be seen as an advancement in the careers of those who began their work in the field as Realtors.  Brokers own real estate offices and often manage administrative duties, while supervising real estate agents and ensuring that all of the state's requirements are met.  Because real estate brokers are also licensed agents, they can also handle the work of listing and selling properties, with some brokers often taking on larger commercial properties.</p>
		<h4>Real Estate Law</h4>
		<p>A real estate degree can be a stepping-stone towards a career in real estate law. Real estate law is complex and attorneys familiar with the industry are necessary for ensuring that the laws are upheld.  Attorneys typically review contracts and assist in sorting through problems that may arise when contract details are vague.  While a real estate degree alone will not ensure a career in real estate law, those with knowledge of the field have a much better chance of succeeding in real estate law if they pursue the study.</p>
