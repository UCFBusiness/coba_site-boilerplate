Admissions Requirements
Our undergraduate business programs prepare students to excel in the real world and obtain leadership positions in the growing global marketplace.  Please keep in mind that admission to UCF does not imply admission to the College of Business Administration and certain requirements need to be met before acceptance into the College. Prior to meeting these requirements, students who plan to pursue a business degree are accepted to the college as preliminary business students; also known as a “business pending.” 
Typically freshmen and sophomore students are restricted in the business courses they may register for and cannot declare a major within the College of Business until they complete the prerequisites necessary to apply and are accepted as upper-division students.  Also students who change from another major or are second degree seeking students and have decided to complete a major in Business will be restricted in the business courses they may register for and cannot declare a major within the College of Business until they complete the prerequisites necessary to apply and be accepted.
Applying to the College of Business Administration is easy and straightforward—if you meet all of the requirements outlined below, your admission is guaranteed!
How to Apply for a Business Major
Because the University does not guarantee acceptance to majors; College of Business students who plan to pursue a business degree are accepted to the college as preliminary business students, also known as “business pending” students.  Students seeking to declare and complete a major as part of the College of Business must meet the following requirements to qualify:

Completion of UCF’s General Education Program, including the Gordon Rule Requirements with a minimum overall GPA of 2.0; or an AA degree awarded from a Florida public institution (including Community College, State College, and University) with a minimum overall GPA of 2.0.
