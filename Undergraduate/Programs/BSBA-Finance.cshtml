	        <h2>Internships</h2>
            <div class="col">
                <p>Department of Finance internships are available to juniors and seniors majoring in finance. To qualify for an internship, undergraduate students must have successfully completed FIN 3403 Business Finance and at least one other 3000 or 4000 level finance course, and must have a minimum overall GPA of 2.75 and a GPA of 3.0 in the major.</p>
                <p>All internships must be related to the field of finance. The objective of the program is to provide students with experience in finance that they would not otherwise have obtained. Therefore, students may not arrange internships with former or current employers. In rare cases, the internship coordinator may approve an internship with a student’s current employer if the job responsibilities assigned to the intern provide a different and appropriate experience in finance.</p>
                <p>The Finance Internship Coordinator is Dr. Richard Curcio. The Finance Internship Packet needs to be filled out and turned into the Finance Department in BA1, room 409 in person. Internship packets are due 10 days before the first day of class of each semester by 4:00pm. (See the UCF academic calendar for the dates). This will allow time for processing paperwork and registering. Late internship application packets will not be accepted after this date. Internship applicants must provide a picture identification (current driver’s license will suffice) and original signatures from the intern employer. If your internship is approved, the Department of Finance will email a permission number to you at your Knights email address allowing you to register for the internship course.</p>
            
                <p>For help finding an Internship, please go to the Business Satellite Office of Experiential Learning, located in BA1, room 130. The phone number is (407) 823-5581 and the website is www.explearning.ucf.edu. </p>
         
                <p>Internships are academic courses that allow students to apply classroom theory in a practical work setting and gain personal, academic and work competencies.</p>
