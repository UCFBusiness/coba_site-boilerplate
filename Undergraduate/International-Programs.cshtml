    <p>The Semester Exchange programs for undergraduate business students are carried out with UCF partner schools. All partner schools hold both regional, and AACSB and/or EQUIS business school accreditation. UCF students must pay UCF tuition, living expenses, and for their travel. Participants can use financial aid, scholarships, and student loans to help cover the cost of these programs. Students must be accepted into a specific program before being allowed to register for classes. UCF students must be registered for at least 12 credit hours during their semester abroad</p>
    <p>College of Business students in The Burnett Honors College have the ability to apply for the IB Scholarship that is sponsored by the College of Business and the Honors College. If you are an Honors student, please make sure to apply for the IB Scholarship before the deadline date in order to be eligible for the scholarship.</p>
    <p>For more information on financial aid, including grants, loans and scholarships, please meet with Ric Colon in the Office of Student Financial Assistance in Millican Hall, Room 120, or send him an email.</p>
    <!--

They are ideal for students with limited time and resources who still want to experience multi-cultural interaction and intellectual growth. Short-term programs offer students the opportunity to immerse themselves in aspects of another culture—the language, literature, history, art and archaeology—as well as have the opportunity to live abroad.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in applying for one of the short-term study abroad programs, you must first contact Faculty Advisor Dr. Robert Sweo in the College of Business Administration. Students will be required to log in to the UCF Study Abroad Online System to apply for the programs.

    <p>The Global Ambassador Program is a volunteer peer advising platform designed specifically for UCF College of Business students who are currently, or have recently returned, from their international education experiences. Having studied abroad, the Ambassadors can attest to the benefits of the international experience and have unique, real-life stories to share with students who are just embarking on their educational endeavors. The Global Ambassadors are a vital component in motivating other students to take advantage of the many international opportunities that studying abroad has to offer. If you want to know what it is really like to live in another country or what the classes are like overseas, contact one of our Global Ambassadors.</p>

    <h5>What would you say to a student who was interested in studying abroad?</h5>
    <p>Studying abroad, particularly in Australia, is truly an unforgettable experience.  I have only been here for a short period of time, but I can already say that it has been a part of my life that I will never forget. You meet so many different people while learning about the world and yourself.</p>
    <p>There is no better time to travel to a place like Australia than while in college. I can say with certainty that this is going to be my favorite memory as an undergraduate at UCF.</p>
    <h5>What do you wish you had known about your program before you left?</h5>
    <p>I wish I knew how much higher the cost of living is in Australia.  Had I known this, I would have tried to save more money.</p>

    <h5>What would you say to a student who was interested in studying abroad?</h5>
    <p>It really changes who you are as a person and your perspective on things. It also helps you become more independent and adapt to situations you might encounter.</p>

    <h5>What would you say to a student who is interested in studying abroad?</h5>
    <p>Studying abroad is the experience of a lifetime.  You get the opportunity to meet people from around the globe, learn using completely different methods and perspectives and gain more outside the classroom than you ever thought possible.  Although there are ways to make studying abroad more affordable, it is worth every cent!</p>
    <h5>What do you wish you had known about your program before you left?</h5>
    <p>I wish that I knew more about the style of teaching and learning in France and at ICN in particular – it is quite different than at UCF.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the classroom atmosphere, however, and the global learning environment is superb!</p>

    <h4>Name: Melissa Hedtke</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Semester Exchange Program or University Name: ICN Business School</li>
        <li>Country Abroad: France</li>

    </ul>
    <h5>What would you say to a student who was interested in studying abroad?</h5>
    <p>I would tell them to consider all aspects of the experience. Studying abroad is much more than just attending a university in another country. There are many experiences you can only get by being in a different place.</p>
    <h5>What do you wish you had known about your program before you left??</h5>
    <p>I wish I had learned more French before coming to Nancy, France. It would have also been helpful to have a list of forms and paperwork I needed to fill out after arriving. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Semester Exchange Program or University Name: IQS-Barcelona</li>
        <li>Country Abroad: Spain</li>
        <li>Semester Abroad: Spring 2013</li>
        <li>Additional Countries Visited While Abroad: Greece, France, Italy</li>

        <li>Minor(s): Economics</li>
        <li>Expected Graduation Date: Fall 2014</li>

    </ul>
    <h5>What would you say to a student who was interested in studying abroad?</h5>
    <p>If you can pull it off comfortably financially, do it, and if you can't do it financially right now, make it your goal to be able to in the near future! Even if it puts you a little behind in your coursework, do it anyway. It is a once in a life time opportunity and you don't want to look back 10 years from now and WISH you had studied abroad. If your reason for not wanting to go is fear, that is all the more reason to do it. Getting out of your comfort zone is the best way to grow as a person.</p>
    <h5>What do you wish you had known about your program before you left?</h5>
    <p>I wish I had a better idea of where I would be living when I got here as well as have more concrete dates for exams.</p>
