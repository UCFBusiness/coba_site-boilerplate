View the course catalog  entry for this program.
The Master of Science in Accounting (MSA) program prepares students for careers as professional accountants and consultants in public accounting, financial institutions, government, and nonprofit organizations. The MSA degree, along with the appropriate prerequisite foundation work from an undergraduate degree in accounting, satisfies the Florida education requirements for the CPA license. Students without an undergraduate degree in accounting will have to take additional business and/or accounting foundation courses. 
Business foundation courses are designed for students with a nonbusiness undergraduate degree (e.g., psychology, education, or engineering).  Accounting foundation courses are designed for students with an undergraduate business degree (e.g., finance, marketing, or management). 
The MST program provides the practical problem solving tools and strong technical knowledge needed to advance in today's financial world. Building on a sound business and accounting foundation, the MST program adds valuable dimension to your knowledge. The MSA degree is awarded upon satisfactory completion of a graduate program of 30 semester hours, and an end-of-program written examination. MST graduates are highly recruited, advance quickly, and are able to shape their future. They are partners. They are consultants and advisors. They own their own practices.
